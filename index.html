        <p>
          I used to work in education, hospitality and in a press office, but I'm still looking for my dream career path. That's why I chose this course! I also think that coding is similar to playing music and I love playing piano!

                <p>After witnessing a Mafia murder, slick saxophone player Joe (Tony Curtis) and his long-suffering buddy, Jerry (Jack Lemmon), improvise a quick plan to escape from Chicago with their lives. Disguising themselves as women, they join an all-female jazz band and hop a train bound for sunny Florida.
